										<h2>What is Pinkelfest?</h2>
										<p>Pinkelfest is a made up Holiday, created by 3 friends. What began as a simple question, has turned into an annual gathering where friends eat, drink, enjoy cigars, hangout and play games including cornhole, giant jenga, and frisbee barrel toss.<br>Wiffle ball used to be the most common game the Pinklers would play, but was soon retired from Pinkelfest in 2017.</p>

										<h2>What is the drink of choice?</h2>
										<p>Beer and Cactus Juice! Originally, when the Pinkelers had no money, they used to drink as much bad beer as possible.<br>They have since matured in taste, like a fine wine, and now serve only quality beer, i.e. Spaten, Dinkelacker.<br>They even include Home Brews including Burch Irish Red and Burch Brown beers.</p>

										<h2>What is Cactus Juice?</h2>
										<p>According to most Pinkeler's, Cactus Juice is the libation of the Gods. It is a margarita flavored schnapps that DeKuypers USED to produce.<br>It is only available in limited quantities. They have cleared out most liquor stores in the Northeast. <br>Pinkelers are always on the lookout for more hidden caches. The bottles are easily identifiable by the inch or so of dust that inevitably forms on the top of the bottles. The Pinkel tradition with Cactus Juice, involves drinking it from The Green Tupperware Bowl with lots of ice.</p>
